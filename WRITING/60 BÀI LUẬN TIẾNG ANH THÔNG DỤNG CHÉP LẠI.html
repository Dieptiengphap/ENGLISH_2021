1 - MY FAMILY

My family consists of 4 people. They are my parents, my sister and me. My father is an engineer working for a government office. My mother is a housewife. My sister is a primary school teacher, and I am a high school student.

We get up at 6 o'clock every morning. After breakfast, my father and my sister go to work, my mother does the housework and I go to school. We have lunch at noon and dinner at 7 p.m. In the evening after dinner, we gather in the sitting-room talking or watching television for about an hour. Then my sister and I retreat to our own rooms to prepare the lessons for the following days.
 My family is a very happy one. We love each other very much and expect to live together under the same roof forever.


 2 - MY MOTHER

 I am living with my parents. My mother is 45 years old. She is not very beautiful, but there is something attractive in her.

 Her facce is oval with big brown eyes and red lips, which are always smiling. She has long black hair, a slim build and a fair complexion. Her character is admirable. She is very sweet and kind to her husband and children. She never gets angry with anyone. As a simple person, she does not like wearing expensive clothes and jewels. She is very busy with the hourse work from early morning until late at night.

 I love my mother very much. I miss her a lot when I am far from her for a long time. When I am free, I help my mother with the washing, cooking and doing errands. I always obey and respect my mother and try to study hard to please her.

 I wish she would live with me forever.
